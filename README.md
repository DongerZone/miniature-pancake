# miniature-panckae
Web based circuit designer and simulator, with the added ability to use an Arduino and block based coding to program it.

Right now, the main focus is on graphics; describing a component using JSON the website should automatically be able to include it in a circuit. Not much else is done yet.

## How to use
For now, just download the repo and open index.html in a web browser. The modular custom JSON component test is being done in modularTest.html
